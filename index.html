        <p>
            <img src="assets/images/Bride and Groom-0290.jpg" alt="Fernando Aguilar" style="width: 200px" class="float-left"> I am a dedicated worker, I strive to do my best in all situations. When there is an answer I do not know I try
            to find the answer for both others and myself. I first dipped my hand into coding in high school, and enjoyed
            it! I enjoy seeing the results of the hard work I put in and also like to support others with the knowledge I
            have or can do the work to find a way to be helpful.I am a quick learner and adaptive to all situations.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am married, I have been working as a Pharmacy Technician since 2014 and now I am taking a new turn towards a creative and
            advancing field that will be more necessary for the future of my life and career. I hope to be ready for all
            the challenges that lay ahead but only time will tell.
